### Project Description:
The objective of this project is to analyze car price data, identify key performance indicators (KPIs), and derive general insights and conclusions from the dataset.
It provides a comprehensive overview of sales performance, helping to inform future strategies and decision-making.

### Dataset:
Initially, the dataset comprised 558,837 rows and 16 columns. After cleaning and preparing it for analysis, the dataset was refined to 558,811 rows and expanded to 18 columns.

### Data Cleaning and Preparation:
To ensure the data was clean, organized, and consistent, the following steps were undertaken:

1. The most critical initial step was copying the data into a new spreadsheet before commencing any data cleaning and preparation.
2. I began by deleting duplicate entries.
3. I verified that each column heading contained a meaningful description and quickly reviewed the overall data in each column to identify any errors or inconsistencies.
4. I added two new columns (month and year) derived from the sale date column using the MID function.
5. After completing all data cleaning and preparation steps, I proceeded with a comprehensive data analysis.
